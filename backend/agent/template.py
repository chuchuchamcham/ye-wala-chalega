"""The parts of a brief that rules write, and the whole brief when no AI can.

The Situation and Evidence lines of every brief come from here, read
straight off the incident's events, because a model on a laptop CPU can
misstate facts (calling a person "a vehicle") and a brief with wrong facts is
worse than none. An AI model adds only judgment on top: links to other
cameras and the next step. When no model answers, the standard next step for
that kind of event completes the brief, so the operator never sees a blank.
