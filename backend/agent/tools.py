"""What the agents can look at, and the one thing they can ask for.

Every tool here only reads. The single exception, propose_action, records a
request that does nothing until an operator approves it. Tool results carry
camera and OCR text (plate readings, zone names) that the agents are told to
treat as data, never as instructions.

Tool inputs are checked here too: Claude's strict mode guarantees the shape,
but a local model does not, and strict mode cannot express number limits.
