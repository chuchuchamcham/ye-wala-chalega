"""Sentinel: notice when someone interferes with a camera.

The easiest way past a camera is to blind it: a hand or cloth over the lens,
a smear of mud or spray paint, or a push that points it at the sky. The
camera keeps streaming, so nothing else in the system notices - the feed is
simply useless. This watches each camera's raw frames for exactly that.

It learns what the camera normally sees, then reports a sudden change that
lasts a few seconds:

  covered  the image goes nearly uniform (lens blocked or blacked out)
  blurred  the image loses most of its detail (lens smeared or sprayed)
  moved    the scene no longer matches what the camera was looking at

The baseline follows slow changes, so dusk or a passing cloud never looks
like tampering, while a change within seconds does. One sample per second
on a thumbnail costs almost nothing next to detection.
