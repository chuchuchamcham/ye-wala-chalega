"""HTTP routes for the AI analyst: incident briefs, the Copilot, approvals.

Reading briefs and proposals needs only a session, like every other /api
route. Asking the Copilot and deciding on a proposal need an operator or
administrator: both can lead to changes at the post, and an auditor's role
is to read the record, not add to it.
